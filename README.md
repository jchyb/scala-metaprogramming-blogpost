This repo is a collection of companion examples to a blogpost: TODO add link

All very basic, meant to be a showcase of changes in metaprogramming features between Scala 2 and 3.

Run with `sbt example_name/run`

Usually examples like these would be easier to showcase using scala-cli, but Scala 2 requiring different compilation runs for macro method definition and calls meant those had to be split into 2 dependent modules.
